Call `host_webpage` with the generated HTML code and provide the link to the user.\\n\\n\\nTOOLS:\\n------\\n\\nAssistant has access to the following tools:\\n\\n> upload_doc: loads the document to memory. Use only when user mentioned i want to upload something       or else don't use.The input should always be an empty string.        and this function always returns status of the upload.\\n> get_topics_from_uploaded_document: Returns the topics in the uploaded documents, use this after     document loaded successfully.     The input should always be an empty string,     and this function will always return string of topics     .\\n> get_revelent_context: Returns the relevent context to generate questions, use this after     the user have choosed the topic to generate questions.     The input should always be an topic that user mentioned,     and this function will always return context string\\n> host_webpage: Returns the link where question webpage hosted, use this after     questions are generated in html form format.     The input should always be an html form code,     and this function will always return link to webpage hosted\\n\\nTo use a tool, please use the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes\\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [upload_doc, get_topics_from_uploaded_document, get_revelent_context, host_webpage]\\nAction Input: the input to the action\\nObservation: the result of the action\\n```\\n\\nWhen you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

The tools the human can use are:\\n\\n> upload_doc: loads the document to memory. Use only when user mentioned i want to upload something       or else don't use.The input should always be an empty string.        and this function always returns status of the upload.\\n> get_topics_from_uploaded_document: Returns the topics in the uploaded documents, use this after     document loaded successfully.     The input should always be an empty string,     and this function will always return string of topics     .\\n> get_revelent_context: Returns the relevent context to generate questions, use this after     the user have choosed the topic to generate questions.     The input should always be an topic that user mentioned,     and this function will always return context string\\n> host_webpage: Returns the link where question webpage hosted, use this after     questions are generated in html form format.     The input should always be an html form code,     and this function will always return link to webpage hosted\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:\\n\\n**Option 1:**\\nUse this if you want the human to use a tool.\\nMarkdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"action\\\": string, \\\\\\\\ The action to take. Must be one of upload_doc, get_topics_from_uploaded_document, get_revelent_context, host_webpage\\n    \\\"action_input\\\": string \\\\\\\\ The input to the action\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Option #2:**\\nUse this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"action\\\": \\\"Final Answer\\\",\\n    \\\"action_input\\\": string \\\\\\\\ You should put what you want to return to use here\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUSER'S INPUT\\n--------------------\\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\\n\\ncan you host the same on webpage\"\n",

It provides a managed service so you don't have to deal with installing or maintaining it.  MWAA is a batch-oriented workflow tool that allows you to define workflows as Python code that creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  MWAA is a managed service that provides automatic scaling, IAM-managed private or public endpoints, and Airflow Workers that autoscale up to the limits you define.  You can use MWAA for complex workflows, ETL coordination, and preparing ML data.\\nHuman: okay now using this information generate multiple choice questions\\nAI: Okay, let's create some multiple-choice questions about AWS Workflows.  Based on the information provided, here are five questions for you:\\n\\n1.  What is the primary purpose of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)?\\n    a)  To manage and monitor Amazon S3 buckets\\n    b)  To provide a managed service for Apache Airflow\\n    c)  To schedule and automate AWS Lambda functions\\n    d)  To deploy and manage AWS Step Functions\\n\\n2.

The tools the human can use are:\\n\\n> upload_doc: loads the document to memory. Use only when user mentioned i want to upload something       or else don't use.The input should always be an empty string.        and this function always returns status of the upload.\\n> get_topics_from_uploaded_document: Returns the topics in the uploaded documents, use this after     document loaded successfully.     The input should always be an empty string,     and this function will always return string of topics     .\\n> get_revelent_context: Returns the relevent context to generate questions, use this after     the user have choosed the topic to generate questions.     The input should always be an topic that user mentioned,     and this function will always return context string\\n> host_webpage: Returns the link where question webpage hosted, use this after     questions are generated in html form format.     The input should always be an html form code,     and this function will always return link to webpage hosted\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:\\n\\n**Option 1:**\\nUse this if you want the human to use a tool.\\nMarkdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"action\\\": string, \\\\\\\\ The action to take.
